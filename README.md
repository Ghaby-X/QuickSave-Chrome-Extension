## Inspiration
Quicksave was inspired by my personal experience while filling out numerous job and school application forms. One of the most common tasks I faced was repeatedly entering my LinkedIn profile link. Instead of constantly opening my LinkedIn page to copy the link, I thought, "Why dont I build an easy way to access frequently used text directly from my browser?" And so, Quicksave was born.

1. Quick Save & Access: Save any text (URLs, notes, etc.) with just a click and retrieve it instantly.
2. Simple & Lightweight: Designed to be straightforward and easy to use.
3. Persistent Storage: Saved texts are available even after closing the browser.
4. Clean UI: A minimal interface that integrates seamlessly with Chrome.

## Installation
1. Download the extension from chrome web store
2. Once installed, click the quicksave icon in the extension toolbar
3. Start saving your frequently used text

## How to Use
Save Text:
1. Click the Quicksave icon in the toolbar.
2. Enter the text or link you want to save and press "Save".
Access Saved Texts:
