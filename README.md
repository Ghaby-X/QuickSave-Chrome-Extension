## Overview
Quicksave is a Chrome extension that lets you save and access texts quickly, just like a bookmark but for snippets of text. Whether it’s a URL, a note, or any other frequently used text, Quicksave is here to make your browsing more efficient.

## Inspiration
Quicksave was inspired by my personal experience while filling out numerous job and school application forms. One of the most common tasks I faced was repeatedly entering my LinkedIn profile link. Instead of constantly opening my LinkedIn page to copy the link, I thought, "Why dont I build an easy way to access frequently used text directly from my browser?" And so, Quicksave was born.

## Features
1. Quick Save & Access: Save any text (URLs, notes, etc.) with just a click and retrieve it instantly.
2. Simple & Lightweight: Designed to be straightforward and easy to use.
3. Persistent Storage: Saved texts are available even after closing the browser.
4. Clean UI: A minimal interface that integrates seamlessly with Chrome.

How to Use
Save Text:
Click the Quicksave icon in the toolbar.
Enter the text or link you want to save and press "Save".
Access Saved Texts:
Click the Quicksave icon to see your saved texts.
Click on any saved item to copy it to your clipboard instantly.
